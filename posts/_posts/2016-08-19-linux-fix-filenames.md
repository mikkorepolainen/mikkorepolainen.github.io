I recently had to move a big media directory (lots of files in many directories and subdirectories) onto a network drive from a linux machine.
As you might expect, there were a lot of problems with file and directory names.
After some frantic googling and testing, I managed to piece together the information presented here: [Sanitize filenames in linux]({% post_url /documents/2016-08-19-linux-fix-filenames %}).
