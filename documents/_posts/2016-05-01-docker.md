About Docker
============

- [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/)

- [Docker Projects](https://www.docker.com/technologies/overview)
- [Docker for beginners](https://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum/)

TODO Aspects
-------

 - Containers
    - Image format
    - Runtime
 - Orchestration (automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications)
    - Scheduling
    - Provisioning (cluster management)
    - Monitoring
    - Fault tolerance
    - Scaling
    - Networking
 - Service Discovery
    - Standalone [Swarm Discovery](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/discovery/) ([libkv](https://github.com/docker/libkv)) supports
       - Consul 0.5.1 or higher
       - Etcd 2.0 or higher [see here](https://coreos.com/etcd/)
       - ZooKeeper 3.4.5 or higher
    - Docker Engine Swarm Mode
       - https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/

 - Security & Isolation
   - Container
   - Host (node)
   - Network
 - Service provider issues
   - Throttling
   - Minimizing traffic costs

Standards
---------

TODO https://coreos.com/blog/making-sense-of-standards/

### OCI

The [Open Containers Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/) (also known as OCP: Open Container Project)
is an effort to standardize the container image format and runtime.

The image specification is still underway (development in [github](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)), based on the Docker v2.2, and draws from CoreOS's [appc spec](https://github.com/appc/spec).
The initial version is [past due](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/milestones).
However, the end result should allow the same container images to be run on both container platforms (*docker* and CoreOS's *rkt*) and any container platform to emerge based on the specification.

Announcements:

- [OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/news/blogs/2016/04/new-image-specification-project-container-images)
- [NewStack](http://thenewstack.io/open-container-initiative-launches-container-image-format-spec/)
- [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/blog/oci-image-specification.html)
-

[runC](http://runc.io/) is a command line tool for running containers, based on the *libcontainer* runtime.
It is lightweight and embeddable, and can be used, for example, with *systemd* instead of the docker engine or *containerd*.

The OCI projects are available in [github](https://github.com/opencontainers/).

 - [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
    - [libcontainer](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/libcontainer)
 - [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)
 - [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec)

[containerd](https://containerd.tools/) is not an OCI project but it is an OCI compatible daemon that controls containers using `runC`. The source code is available in [github](https://github.com/docker/containerd)

The docker engine [starting with version 1.11](https://blog.docker.com/2016/04/docker-engine-1-11-runc/) is based on *containerd* and *runC*.

### CNCF

[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) is a joint effort to harmonize and drive the adoption of technologies suitable for cloud native systems.

Hosted [projects](https://cncf.io/projects):

 - [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/): Container orchestration platform.
 - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. See [overview](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

Ecosystems
----------

 - Docker
    - Docker image spec, soon OCI compatible?
    - Built in clustering with Swarm
    - Built in virtual networking
    - TODO which "batteries" are not included? Service Discovery?
 - CoreOS
    - appc image spec, soon OCI compatible?
    - TODO married to Kubernetes?
    - Cluster service discovery using [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/)
    - Virtual networking with [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel)
