General notes on using docker.
Further information in separate documents:

Installing Docker
=================

Linux
------

Quick install: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`

Add user to docker group for use without sudo:

- `sudo usermod -aG docker <user>`
- Restart the docker service (e.g. `sudo service docker restart` on Ubuntu)
- Log out and back in again.

Removing:

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get purge docker-engine
apt-get autoremove --purge docker-engine
rm -rf /var/lib/docker
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the last command removes also all volumes and configuration data from containers.

Docker Toolbox (Windows & Mac OS)
----------------------

Download and install [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).
The toolbox contains the docker tools (including docker-machine and docker-compose), Kitematic (an UI for managing containers) and Oracle VirtualBox installer.

If you don't plan to run containers on top of a local VirtualBox instance, then you can leave VirtualBox unchecked in the installer (e.g. if you plan to use Hyper-V on windows).

### Local Container Host for Development

Running Kitematic spins up a new local VM called `default` on top of VirtualBox.
At the time of writing, the Kitematic UI only supports the VirtualBox driver and a local VM called `default`
(you can have a stab at the kitematic source code and compile it yourself though, see [here](http://agup.tech/2015/08/14/hacking-at-kitematic-with-hyper-v-on-windows-10/))).

Alternatively, you can run `docker-machine create --driver <driver name> <vm-name>` on the command line followed by `docker-machine start <vm-name>`.

Read [Docker Hosts]({% post_url 2016-05-15-docker-hosts %}) for information on creating local hosts using docker-machine (e.g. creating a host on Hyper-V instead of VirtualBox on windows).

Docker for Windows/Mac
----------------------

A more native-like replacement for docker toolbox. The tool is in beta stage at the time of writing (invite token required).
Uses Hyper-V on Windows and xhyve on mac as the virtualization host. See [here](https://beta.docker.com/docs/) for more info.
Community forums can be found here: [windows](https://forums.docker.com/c/docker-for-windows), [mac](https://forums.docker.com/c/docker-for-mac).

To install, download and run the installer (InstallDocker.msi on windows, Docker.dmg on mac).
This installs the tools and sets up a VM (named MobyLinuxVM) on the virtualization host.
The installer provides an option for starting the virtual machine after installation.

The beta version requires an invite token on first startup.

The whale icon on the status bar can be used to access virtual machine settings (CPUs, Memory, automatic startup)
and to shut down the virtual machine (exit).
