# General

- List of [Products](https://cloud.google.com/products/)
- [Solutions](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/) (products by use case)

See also [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (mobile app platform built on top of GCP).

Main concept in GCP is the *project*.
All operations in the GCP (except managing projects themselves) are performed in the context of a project.
The project is also the primary method of grouping resources and many services have a 1-to-1 relationship with the project.
For example, you cannot have two or more separate datastore service instances within a single project.
(Instead, you must use namespaces to isolate data if required.)

## Feature mapping

- By Google:
  - [AWS](<https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-aws-google-cloud-platform>)
  - [Azure](<https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-azure-google-cloud-platform>)
- 3rd party rather up-to-date side by side mapping: <https://ilyas-it83.github.io/CloudComparer/>

# Platform

[APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/): browse and try Google APIs in a browser (including authenticated requests)
e.g. `https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/datastore/datastore/v1beta3/datastore.projects.runQuery`

## Tools

# Storage Options

<https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/>

## Cloud DataStore

- *Entities* with *properties*
- Partitioned by *namespace* (and project id)
- *Kind* is logical grouping, like a collection or table (GQL uses kind in the FROM clause).
- Co-located with app engine region
